<h1>Frame Calculator</h1>
A python script for converting NES frames to real time.<br>
This is meant for Super Mario Bros 1 but can be used for any NES game.<br>
To run the script, navigate to the file location in the terminal and run <code>python calc.py</code><br>
In SMB1, timing starts when the 400 appears in 1-1 and ends when all sprites become invisable after hitting the axe.<br>
This can only be used for NTSC which runs at 60.0988139 frames per second.
